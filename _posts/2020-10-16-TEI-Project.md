The process of coding, or learning to code, is not an easy one to master, as it involves learning a new language and leaves no room for error. In our Writing for the Digital Humanities course, we were individually assigned the task of translating a passage from Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s, “The Yellow Wall-Paper” into TEI. TEI stands for Text Encoding Initiative, and in summary, it is a way to translate texts into a format that is readable by machines, which contributes to the field of Digital Humanities or simply to modern technological academia. The entire project can be broken down into two parts, the translation of the text to a google doc, and then the conversion of this text to TEI code through Oxygen XML. While they sound like two simple concepts, the execution of these steps was far from a walk in the park. However, nothing good in life comes easy, and the knowledge and appreciation I now have of text encoding made it all worthwhile. 


The first step in this process was to take the original section of “The Yellow Wall-Paper” and put it in a document that could easily be manipulated, which was done for us by the Professor. This needed to be done to ensure we could correct the text for any misspelling, punctuation, or grammatical errors after revision. It is crucial that the text is exactly the same as the original to maintain a perfectly accurate translation to the author’s. My text appeared flawless, so it was a very straightforward process as I carefully analyzed each word to ensure it was identical to the original. Next, we practiced annotating our document for where coding would be necessary, and this helped ease us into the process of working with TEI. This was incredibly beneficial, as practicing with no real consequences or an unfamiliar editor was a smooth way to dip our toes into the waters of TEI coding. 


After this came the more difficult portion of the project, which was to take this text and translate it to TEI through code. While I had little knowledge of the correct sequence of letters and symbols to perform this task, the learning curve was rather quick, as it required less memorization of these tags than I expected. When working with TEI we were expected to use tags to encode part of the text such as page numbers, paragraphs, em dashes, misspellings, quotes, italics, and titles. This was done by utilizing symbols and letters in the correct order before placing the text within the Oxygen document, like <p> </p> around separate paragraphs. Here is an example of this coding in use on my portion of the passage:

At first, the different colors and symbols were overwhelming and foreign to me, as I had never used Oxygen XML or done much work with coding. After learning through repetitive trial and error, however, I was able to get a grasp on the function of these different colors and symbols, and even understood how to use the Author function to view how my coding looked when processed. My passage from “The Yellow Wall-Paper” was incredibly simple and required only code for paragraphs, page numbers, and em dashes, because there were no italics, misspelled words, quotes, or images in my assigned section. While this method of individually placing code around the many different section of my passage could be viewed as tedious, I found it rather rewarding to finish each line and see the green square at the top of the editing page. The green square, which can be seen in the top right corner of the above image, means the code is correct and functioning properly. If there are any errors it appears red. I had my fair share of time with the red square, but after all of the code was understood more thoroughly, it became more common for me to finish a line and see green! 


TEI is an important aspect of the Digital Humanities, because once old or paper texts are translated to this format, they are able to be read and processed by machines, like computers! This provides for a much more thorough analysis of works and the ability to manipulate or find specific sections of old, paper, or even ancient texts. This project taught me a great deal about the work that goes into translating text to the TEI format, like copying it exactly as the source and then utilizing code in software like Oxygen. This knowledge is incredibly valuable to me as an English major, because much of the work I do revolves around using texts on the internet or scholarly databases. Not only do I now understand the extensive work and careful steps needed to make these texts available to people like me, but I have a much deeper appreciation for the Digital Humanities as a whole.
