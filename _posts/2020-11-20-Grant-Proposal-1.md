### **From the Pages to the Screen: A Batman Grant Proposal Update**

As a long-time fan of superhero culture and media, when I was given the opportunity to craft a grant for a digital humanities project of my choice, something within this field immediately became my focus. I originally wanted to create a database in which information that compared comic book films to their printed counterparts was displayed side by side, utilizing hyperlinks that take you to different key aspects of the selected film or hero. Now, the vehicle used in interacting with my project will remain the same, but as I am only one person it seemed more fitting to narrow the scope of my concept to specifically Batman films. Now, my idea is to propose a grant for the development of my project which would hypothetically publish on its own website, be uniquely interactable and simple to navigate, and provide concise but thorough, analysis of key aspects within Batman films, like costumes, themes, characters, setting, color palletes, world building, etc., and compare them to their comic book counterparts. 


There is already a wide scope of information published in web articles, blogs, and magazines that cover either an extremely specific comparison between comics and films, or a very broad stroke. In regards to a _database_ of information regarding this topic, other than [batman.fandom.com](https://batman.fandom.com/wiki/Batman_Wiki) (which has an excellent amount of user-submitted information about everything to do with The Dark Knight, but more on that later), there does not seem to be anything made **specifically** for the sake of comparing printed media to their cinematic renditions. With the information and publications that are available, however, there is ample knowledge for comparison and research regarding the facts about Batman and his presence both in print and digital media.

In 2015, Aaron Hatch published the article above on _The Artifice_, and went into significant detail regarding the portrayal of Batman and Superman in Zack Snyder’s film, _Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice_. Here, he analyzed the two comic books that Snyder drew most heavily upon when writing and directing the film, and gave a close analysis of the many similarities and differences between the films and their printed counterparts. A link to the full article is provided [here](https://the-artifice.com/batman-and-superman-comparing-two-iconic-superheroes/)! There are a plethora of niche articles like this one available to provide insight as to inspiration and comparison of Batman films and comics, but they generally all tackle the comparison of one movie, and are published as an individual article.


This is where my idea sets itself apart and grounds its concept in the digital humanities. By providing a database as opposed to an article, as well as utilizing hyperlinks and side by side comparison, my project is crafted in a manner that is far more suited to research as the navigation will be more specific and the user will have more control over what exactly they are looking for. In fact, my idea is to format the site much like the previously mentioned [batman.fandom.com](https://batman.fandom.com/wiki/Batman_Wiki) because of its emphasis on research and navigation!

The site will open much like the image of batman.fandom.com above, with the option to select either a specific Batman character or film. Then, the user will be taken to another set of options where they can choose what key aspects of the film or character they want to see compared. Should they choose “all of the above,” the site would then provide every analysis I have made between the characters or films and their comic book counterparts, however, if they were to select “themes,” for example, they would simply be navigated to the section of the site where themes of their character or film are analyzed and compared. 


The creation of this grant has been one that I have quite enjoyed, due to the fact that most of my research and work has revolved around something that I am passionate about, but it certainly has not been easy. An extensive amount of work went into preparing all of the necessary sources of my Environmental Scan and Bibliography, as I had never done research of this caliber before and proper education on both print to film projects and the general digital humanities needed to be conducted. Also, budgeting and the proper formulation of my grant are two pieces that I certainly need to educate myself more thoroughly on in order to do this project the **justice** it deserves. My knowledge of web design, grant writing, and the proper funding a project of my stature would require is certainly lacking, but these concept have become the primary focus of my current research. With this, my understanding of the digital humanities and grant writing in general has significantly strengthened through the process, as composing an Environmental Scan and Bibliography allowed me to be exposed to a wide range of ideas, articles, projects, websites, and journals that are providing insight to every aspect of the project as a whole. 


It is my hope that with my project's interactable nature and passionate focus on research and analysis, its relevance and unique contribution to the digital humanities will make it a grant proposal that even Bruce Wayne would invest in!
