As we reach the end of both our Grant Proposal Project and Digital Humanities class, it seems fitting to tie it all together with a concluding entry. What begun as just an idea for a superhero-based website as a final project spiraled into a full-fledged grant proposal that I am both passionate about and proud of. I had never done work with grant writing or proposals, and I certainly never had the freedom of choosing any subject of my choice for a school assignment, but these two concepts came together to make something that is both informative for me as an English Major, as well as interesting and focused.


In the beginning, my idea was to build a website that highlighted the many similarities and differences between comic book films and their printed inspirations, but this focus was quickly narrowed to Batman specific films and comics. This allowed for a more detailed and easy-to-tackle foundation, as my research could be funneled into one hero as opposed to the vast assortment of knowledge that is available for superhero works in general.

This narrowing of my idea lead to a very detailed and informative research session to construct my Environmental Scan, which was, coincidentally, the first piece of the Grant Proposal puzzle that I needed to learn. Through the creation of my Environmental Scan (shown partially above), I was able to gain a great deal of knowledge regarding comic books and their relationship to the Digital Humanities. This research narrowed the scope of my project even further, as I now understood the necessary components for a Digital Humanities contribution as well as what previous comic-based scholarship consisted of. Thanks to this newfound understanding, I focused my project’s purpose to being that of an interactable database, and I was able to set myself apart from previous endeavors within the field by incorporating the side-by-side comparison format. 


The composition of my Grant Narrative and Budget came next, and while their concepts were a little more straightforward, they made a hefty contribution to my understanding of grant writing and the importance of thorough explanations. Grant Narratives allow the proposer to explain the concepts of their project while simultaneously highlighting its relevance and importance. Detailed explanations are crucial because it sells the idea to those who would be funding its completion. Also, no one wants to invest in something that is unfamiliar or confusing, so providing a plethora or crucial information while remaining engaging and concise was a skill that was certainly gained through the composition of the Grant Narrative and Budget. Once again, the focus of my project began to fall into place as the project moved forward, and I could now see its concept in its completion over the horizon.

My project idea was complete, and it was to be a database that broke down key concepts from Batman films and compared them to the comic books that they were based upon. Users could choose between either specific characters or films from the Batman universe, and a variety of concepts would then be displayed and available for further selection and analysis. The selections would be [hyperlinks](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-hyperlinks-work-2483287) that take the user to individual pages of information that are all present on the webpage itself. The concepts that can be maneuvered between include themes, costumes, setting, technology, relationships, origins, etc. Once one is selected, the hyperlink takes the user to an analysis (written by me) that compares the selected concept between the films and their comic book counterparts. 


Finally, after the idea for my project was complete and satisfactory, all that was left was to sell myself and my capabilities of completing this project to the funders. The purpose of a grant proposal is, after all, to receive funding for the completion of the project based on the proposer’s idea and capabilities. This was done by tweaking my resume to best display my achievements and abilities in a way that showcases comprehension in areas crucial to the project. This was another first for me, as all of my previous resume experience was tailored to landing a job, not completing an academic research project. 


In the end, my resume didn’t include qualities like _billionaire, philanthropist, playboy,_ or _caped crusader_, but it was the best showcase of my academic and extra-curricular capabilities that I could compose. Although this project was never intended to _actually_ receive Grant funding, it provided me with a vast plethora of knowledge and skills that will be immensely beneficial to me as a Senior English Major who is about to leave the **Batcave** and take on the competitive real-world.
