This is my **introductory blog**.
Hello! My name is Logan Penland and I am a Senior English Major at **Christopher Newport University** in Newport News, Virginia. This blog will be a collection of my assignments and ideas regarding the Digital Humanities. I first took an interest in this course once I finally learned what exactly the Digital Humanities is, which is the academic field that combines traditional scholarship with modern technology. This immediately intrigued me, because with the ever-growing wave of academic technology, and my passion for English and writing, it seemed imperative to get a grasp on the many ways that writing is woven in! Hopefully, at the end of this course I will have a greater understanding of the Digital Humanities as a whole, as well as make myself a better writer along a fresh medium. 


In regards to my pursuits after college, I have always been drawn to the academics and the idea of teaching what I enjoy, but I believe the most productive next step would be to go to graduate school and receive my masters. After this, I will have the knowledge and experience to tackle teaching at the high school level. Although I have a long way to go before pursuing these passions, the reward of working directly with future generations in their academic endeavors, as well as the ability to work closely with a subject I enjoy is all the more reason to keep on pushing! 


Writing has always been my favorite portion of academics, since elementary school, so choosing to pursue this branch of education at the college level was a no brainer. In my first three years of higher education I have completed and thoroughly enjoyed classes on rhetoric, creative writing, film writing, theater, literature spanning across multiple generations, and tutoring at the Christopher Newport University Writing Center. Currently, I am enrolled in classes that will help me hone my skills in writing for the Digital Humanities, and for the Profession, like technical writing. 


Outside of scholarship I am a founding father and the second term recruitment chair for the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta at CNU, which has been an incredible experience for a variety of reasons. It has allowed me to express myself and leave my mark on Christopher Newport by building a successful Fraternity from the ground up, as well as develop many skills in recruitment and event planning. I was also a lead planner for our largest philanthropy event, Fraternity Feud, which raised over $500 for the USO! 

Beyond all of this, however, I am a huge movie, superhero, outdoors, and dog lover! My favorite movies of all time are the Christopher Nolan Dark Knight trilogy, which is perfect because my favorite superhero is Batman. My favorite hobbies are fishing and hiking, and I am the proud owner of 3 dogs, one of which is 17 years old!
