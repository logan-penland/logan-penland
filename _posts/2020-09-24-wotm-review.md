### **The New York Public Library's Collection of Menus from 1850-Present Day: A Digital Humanities Review**

**Project:** What’s on the menu? The New York Public Library’s Restaurant Menu Collection
**Project Director:** Ben Vershbow
**Project URL:** [http://menus.nypl.org/menus](http://menus.nypl.org/menus)

There is over a century’s worth of restaurant menus at the New York Public Library’s disposal, thanks to Miss Frank E. Buttolph. She began collecting these menus in the year 1900, and she gathered 25,000 of these items on her own. Since then, the efforts to grow the Library’s collection has sparked nearly 45,000 menus to be collected by the patrons and staff of the New York Public Library. In 2011, a team headed by Ben Vershbow and a large number of volunteers began to transcribe the food and beverage items available on these documents, to compose an impressive project within the Digital Humanities.
	
  
  This project was titled, “What’s on the menu,” and it consists of an ever growing compilation of information that allows the user to interact with a timeline and search bar to find both menus and specific food and drink items from any specific time period between 1850 and 2008, down to a specific year. The purpose of this project was to provide the general public as well as researchers, chefs, novelists, historians, and food enthusiasts with accurate historical data for research or interest purposes. 
	
  
  The project goes further than simply providing over 17,000 menus and 427,000 recorded menu items, however, because along with the tabs for searching these items there are blogs and a plethora of information regarding how this information was collected. The blogs provided are all composed by writers who are associated with the Library, and they contain detailed history as well as interesting information regarding many of the restaurants and the food items that were available throughout time. If the user was simply interested in how this information was compiled, or how they could assist in the future endeavors of this project, they could also easily find this information under “data” or “about” in the tabs provided. 
	
  
  The process for gathering and compiling this data was done through the careful analysis and manual transcription by hundreds of volunteers at the New York Public Library. They were to sift through the unused menus and transcribe every food and drink item, their price, and any additional information they could find about the meals as they sort it into a database that compiles all of their work together and places it on a timeline for easy access. They even go as far to include pictures of the menus as well as any pictures of the food or drinks that the menu accurately provides. While this is an impressive collection of useful information in itself, the project states that they plan on expanding the knowledge provided to sort geographically, as well as partnering with other libraries or menu collections to greatly expand the scope of content they can provide. 


The [“What’s on the menu”](http://menus.nypl.org/menus) project is incredibly engaging, as well as easy to understand and navigate for even the average person’s peruse, like myself, as they can quickly find themselves lost in the thousands of data entries that display the interesting and ever-changing dishes offered in historical America. While this project appeals to even the common passerby, the information provided could be invaluable to those conducting research as a historian, chef, novelist, or anyone who has a need to learn about food throughout history in a precise and accurate manner. Since the exact time period, price, and location of every menu item is provided, this project could prove to be an incredibly valuable tool for chefs looking to provide a throwback meal, novelists looking for an accurate price on oysters in 1876, or even historians looking for a time period in which the apple pie first became a popular menu item.
